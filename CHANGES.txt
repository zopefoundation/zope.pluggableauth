2.0.0a2 (unreleased)
--------------------

- Refactored ``zope.pluggableauth.plugins.session.redirectWithComeFrom``
  into a reusable function.


2.0.0a1 (2013-02-21)
--------------------

- Added `tox.ini` and `MANIFEST.in`.

- Added support for Python 3.3.

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.


1.3 (2011-02-08)
----------------

- As the camefrom information is most probably used for a redirect, require
  it to be an absolute URL (see also
  http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30).

1.2 (2010-12-16)
----------------

- SessionCredentialsPlugin has a hook (_makeCredentials) that can be overriden
  in subclasses to store the credentials in the session differently.

  For example, you could use keas.kmi and encrypt the passwords of the
  currently logged-in users so they don't appear in plain text in the ZODB.

1.1 (2010-10-18)
----------------

* Moved concrete IAuthenticatorPlugin implementations from
  zope.app.authentication to zope.pluggableauth.plugins.

  As a result projects that want to use the IAuthenticator plugins (previously
  found in zope.app.authentication) do not automatically also pull in the
  zope.app.* dependencies that are needed to register the ZMI views.

1.0.3 (2010-07-09)
------------------

* Fixed dependency declaration.

1.0.2 (2010-07-90)
------------------

* Added persistent.Persistent and zope.container.contained.Contained as
  bases zope.pluggableauth.plugins.session.SessionCredentialsPlugin, so
  instances of zope.app.authentication.session.SessionCredentialsPlugin
  won't be changed.

1.0.1 (2010-02-11)
------------------

* Adapters are now declared in a new ZCML file :
  `principalfactories.zcml`. This avoids duplication errors in
  ``zope.app.authentication``.

1.0 (2010-02-05)
----------------

* Splitting off from zope.app.authentication
