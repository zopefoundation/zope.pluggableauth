Changes
=======

2.1.0 (2016-07-04)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.5.

- Drop support for Python 2.6.


2.0.0 (2014-12-24)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.4.

- Refactor ``zope.pluggableauth.plugins.session.redirectWithComeFrom``
  into a reusable function.

- Fix: allow password containing colon(s) in HTTP basic authentication
  credentials extraction plug-in, to conform with RFC2617


2.0.0a1 (2013-02-21)
--------------------

- Add ``tox.ini`` and ``MANIFEST.in``.

- Add support for Python 3.3.

- Replace deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.

- Replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Drop support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.


1.3 (2011-02-08)
----------------

- As the ``camefrom`` information is most probably used for a redirect,
  require it to be an absolute URL (see also
  http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30).

1.2 (2010-12-16)
----------------

- Add a hook to ``SessionCredentialsPlugin`` (``_makeCredentials``) that can
  be overriden in subclasses to store the credentials in the session
  differently.

  For example, you could use ``keas.kmi`` and encrypt the passwords of the
  currently logged-in users so they don't appear in plain text in the ZODB.

1.1 (2010-10-18)
----------------

- Move concrete ``IAuthenticatorPlugin`` implementations from
  ``zope.app.authentication`` to ``zope.pluggableauth.plugins``.

  As a result, projects that want to use the ``IAuthenticator`` plugins
  (previously found in ``zope.app.authentication``) do not automatically
  also pull in the ``zope.app.*`` dependencies that are needed to register
  the ZMI views.

1.0.3 (2010-07-09)
------------------

- Fix dependency declaration.

1.0.2 (2010-07-90)
------------------

- Add ``persistent.Persistent`` and ``zope.container.contained.Contained`` as
  bases for ``zope.pluggableauth.plugins.session.SessionCredentialsPlugin``,
  so instances of ``zope.app.authentication.session.SessionCredentialsPlugin``
  won't be changed.

1.0.1 (2010-02-11)
------------------

* Declare adapter in a new ZCML file : `principalfactories.zcml`.  Avoids
  duplication errors in ``zope.app.authentication``.

1.0 (2010-02-05)
----------------

* Splitting off from zope.app.authentication
